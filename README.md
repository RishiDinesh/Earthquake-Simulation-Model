# Earthquake-Simulation-Model

### Abstract
The aim of this project is to implement the various OS scheduling algorithms in an earthquake simulation to effectively carry out the various disaster management activities and minimise the casualties. In order to achieve this goal, we lay out the various steps that have to be followed after an earthquake and propose a parameterized simulation model that can be fine-tuned to carry out these steps in the most efficient manner. The various algorithms used in this project are FCFS, SJF, Priority and Round Robin schedulers.

Stages of the model
- Initialization
- Evacuation
- First-aid
- Medical attention
- Food collection
- Food distribution
- Damage inspection
- Rebuilding and Reconstruction
